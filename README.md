Whistle is the last group project at Le Wagon Berlin. This project has been presented at Factory Berlin after the 9 weeks of coding Bootcamp.
This app is about alerting your friends instantly while you are harassed or feel unsafe in the street.
As a user you can set a destination and see the route on the map
As a user you can see the partner establishment that are on the route
As a user you can share your trip/route to your contact(s)
As a user you can alert your friend(s) that you are in danger
As a user you can send your current location while pressing the "Whistle" button
As a user you can mark yourself as safe
We also tend to create a partner establishment network in order for the user to see on the map the open establishements that can help on the spot.

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
